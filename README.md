# Assocs: Rules Mining Tool

## Overview
**Assocs** is a rules mining tool designed to mine associations from transaction data. It runs on the R interface and provides a Rules Mining window and a Graphing window. The rules mining and graphing functionality is based on the methodologies outlined in Hahsler et al. (2006) and Hahsler et al. (2016).

## Installation Methods

### Standard Shiny Installation
To run the application using Shiny, execute the following code in your R environment:

    if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
    pacman::p_load("Rgraphviz", "shiny", "tidyverse", "arules", "arulesViz", "colorspace", "visNetwork", "plotly", "igraph", "shinythemes", "readxl", "DT")
    runGitHub(
      'Assocs',
      username = 'statisticsguru1',
      ref = "main"
    )

## Using Assocs

### Launching the Application
After installation, you can launch the app by clicking the app icon found among your Windows applications.

### Application Tabs
The application consists of two main tabs:
- **Tab A: Rules**
  - This tab is for loading data, mining rules, and downloading the mined rules.
- **Tab B: Graphing**
  - This tab is for graphing the mined rules and downloading the graphs.

### Mining Rules
To mine rules, follow these steps:
1. **Data Upload:**
   - Click "Browse" to select a data file (CSV or Excel). The default file type is CSV.
   - Specify if the first row contains variable names (default is TRUE).
   - Specify the file type (default is CSV).

2. **Rules Input:**
   - Set the minimum support value (default is 0).
   - Set the minimum confidence value (default is 0).
   - Set the minimum length of item sets (default is 2).
   - Set the maximum length of item sets (default is 2).
   - Optionally exclude zero counts (default is selected).
   - Click "Mine rules" to start mining the rules.

3. **Download Rules:**
   - The mined rules will be displayed, and you can download them by clicking the "Download" button.

### Graphing Rules
After extracting the rules, you can graph them using the Graphing window:

1. **Static Graphs:**
   - Select the graph type from the dropdown.
   - Specify the measure of interestingness (default is lift).
   - Specify the shading measure (default is support).
   - Click "Go" to generate the graph.
   - Download the graph by clicking the "Download graph" button.

2. **Interactive Graphs:**
   - The inputs for interactive graphs are similar to static graphs.
   - The graph can be downloaded directly from the graph interface.
